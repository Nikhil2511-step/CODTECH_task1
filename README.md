OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT :-
The Weather Forecast App aims to deliver accurate and real-time weather information directly through a frontend application, without relying on any backend server. This app provides users with essential weather details, including current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions like sunny, rainy, or cloudy. Users can also view daily and hourly forecasts for the next seven days, complete with temperature highs and lows, precipitation chances, and weather conditions. The app features a user-friendly interface designed with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure responsiveness across various devices. It allows users to search for weather data by city name or ZIP code and supports temperature units in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. By integrating a public weather API such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI directly into the JavaScript code, the app fetches and displays real-time weather data. The development process includes designing and planning the user interface, building the frontend, and testing for compatibility and performance. The app is deployed on static hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. This project not only provides a practical tool for users to check weather conditions but also demonstrates frontend development skills, showcasing the ability to integrate APIs and create a responsive design. Future enhancements could include features like default location settings or additional weather information to further enrich the user experience.
